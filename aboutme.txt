1) Describe yourself in two to three sentences. 
"An introvert that loves people and quality time with them, but dislikes a long period of quality time. I'm a witty person (I think in puns), I love to write (currently writing a book), and I'm the most social stutterer; in other words, I sometimes talk l-l-like th-th-thi-i-ssss. "

2) What's important to you? 
Understanding why I was created. I am a Christian, and like to educate myself in Theology and Philosophy. Jesus Christ is important to me, because without Him I would only be nothing but a bunch of cells that lives only to one day die. 

Where are you from? 
I am from America. My parents are from Iran, and we are Armenian. I was born in America, though.

What are your favorite hobbies?
I am a self-taught drummer by the age of 4, but music exhaustes me. I eat, gulp drinks, blink, etc.. to rhythmes. I've been kicked out of many classrooms in my Elementary days for my drum solos in the middle of learning about useless things. I don't like public education. 

What's your dream job? 
I love to write, and wish to one day be a well-known author of series of books, but I have a passion for coding, and therefore would like to be a successful developer of many things. To the future *toast*

What music have you been listening to lately? 
I'll say what I don't listen to: music on popular radio stations. I despise many of today's music, only because they lack the sophistication of many older music (notice my use of word "many" and not "all"). I love to listen to piano instrumentals, only instruments being played without lyrics. I believe that way you create your Own song, rather than listen to someone else's. All though that is quite a simple class of music, it is still sophisticated, not simplistic.
