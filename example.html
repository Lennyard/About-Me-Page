  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p> I'm an introvert that loves people and quality time with them, but dislikes a long period of quality time. I'm a witty person (I think in puns), I love to write (currently writing a book), and I'm the most social stutterer; in other words, I sometimes talk l-l-like th-th-thi-i-ssss.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p> I am from America. My parents are from Iran, and we are Armenian. But I was born in America. </p>

  <h1> More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p> I am a self-taught drummer by the age of 4, but music exhaustes me. I eat, gulp drinks, blink, etc.. to rhythmes. I've been kicked out of many classrooms in my Elementary days for my drum solos in the middle of learning about useless things. I don't like public education.</p>
  <h2> What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p> I love to write, and wish to one day be a well-known author of series of books, but I have a passion for coding, and therefore would like to be a successful developer of many things. To the future *toast*</p>
  <h2>What's your background?</h2>
    <p>To be completely honest, the first time I saw code for a program I didn't understand how anyone could work on it without being crazy. You would've had to have been a computer yourself to understand it. It looked like a bunch of colorful ancient hieroglyphics and I thought to myself that of all the crazy people, my father used to be a great programmer. Well before seeing the first piece of code I ever saw, I used to think I thought like a computer. I made lists in my mind, little details about specific people and could tell them apart a mile away. So, I figured if my father was good at it, maybe I would be good at it too, since I thought like a computer and was a computer's son. In order to understand this madness-of-a-career I thought I should try it out myself. I took an Intro to C and C++ programming class in my 2nd semester of community college. I couldn't stand it so I sat down and dreaded along the lessons. I knew what the professor was saying, I understood the concept but I did not like it one bit. Though I had many reasons to change my career plan to something more of my taste, I stuck with it like it was calling to me, only I literally couldn't understand its language so I didn't respond too well and I naively, yet fortunately, dropped the class. Why fortunately? Because if I hadn't dropped it I wouldn't have gone straight to web development. At first it was reasonably boring, but then it hit me! I loved web development! I loved the response time, I loved seeing progress right before my eyes. I was actually having fun learning to program. Shortly after that I remembered thinking to myself that programmers are crazy for writing code, but now that I have tasted it for myself and learned to love it, it became more of a fact than an opinion, because my dad put a stop to his programming career to work as an insurance broker, and once a programmer always a programmer.</p>
  <h2> What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>I'll say what I don't listen to: music on popular radio stations. I despise many of today's music, only because they lack the sophistication of many older music (notice my use of word "many" and not "all"). I love to listen to piano instrumentals, only instruments being played without lyrics. I believe that way you create your Own song, rather than listen to someone else's. All though that is quite a simple class of music, it is still sophisticated, not simplistic.</p>
